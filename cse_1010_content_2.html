                <p>
                    This section is much easier and quicker than the previous ones. In this section, I have learned how to use variables and basic animation. Lets first see how to use variables. Variables are a way to store data to be reused later. For example, you can use variables to store the size of something. You can then pass the variable's name instead of the number for the size. Now, this sounds useless right now but variables are extremely useful. First off, you can put all your variables together so whenever you need to change something, you don't have to search through the entire code. Second, this allows you to change anything whenever you want with ease. Last but not least, this can be used multiple times. Let's use the previous example, say you want to make a square, you can make a second square of the same size at a different position with ease. Overall, variables are one of the most used things in programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Anyways, let's see how you make them. In some languages, you need to specify what type of data you want to store(string(text), int(number), etc...), although, javascript does this automatically for you. Simply make sure to say its a variable. To make the variable, you simply say "var" followed by the name, an equal sign and the value. Like this...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                	<li>Var size = 6;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	Here, you have created a variable called "size" which has a value of 6. Now you can go ahead and type the name of the variable instead everytime instead of writing 6. This might seem like a lot more work than simply typing 6, but overall it is a much better practice since next time you will need to change this "6" multiple times, variables will come in handy. As a quick side note, variables can also not have any value, null... This means that no value is present. This can be practical sometimes as this allows you to set the value when specific conditions are met. Anyways, now that we know how to use variables, let's learn how to make basic animations. This is still quite simple! All you need to do to prepare this is using 1 very specific function. The draw function. This function repeats anything(inside of it) until you tell it to stop by closing the window. This is what we are going to be using for animating since the drawing should be redrawn at different positions multiple times and not just once. This is what the draw function should look like.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                	<li>draw = function() {</li>
                	<li class="comment"><em></em>	//Blah blah blah, just random function stuff here</li>
                	<li>}</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	Although this is the most important part of animation, this is not the only one. At this point, if you put anything in the function(such as create a rectangle), nothing will happen that isn't normal. Now, if you want the rectangle to move across the screen, you will need 3 things. A variable, increasing the variable, use a variable for the position of the rectangle. First off, simply create the variable like normal. Although... the value you give to the variable will be the starting position of the rectangle. Just make sure to create the variable outside of the function. If the variable is inside the function the variable will be recreated everytime, rendering this useless as it will not change. After that, you simply want to create whatever it is you want to make and simply feed the variable instead of the position. After all that is done, you simply want to increase the variable by any number. The lower the slower. Try adjusting by 2 and change the speed accordingly, the 2 is just to see how fast this goes so you can make an approximation of the speed you actually want. This is how it should look.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                	<li>Var x = 0;</li>
                	<li>draw = function() {</li>
                	<li><em></em>	rect(x, 100, 100, 100);</li>
                	<li><em></em>	x = x + 2;</li>
                	<li>}</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	Sweet! Now you get to see a square mo-... get bigger???? This is weird. Instead of moving, the square got bigger. The variable is in the correct spot, there is just one small issue with this. This "draw" function simply draws on the screen as the name suggests. Spotted the issue? This simply creates a square 2 pixels to the right everytime but it doesn't remove the one before. The answer... background. You need to add the "background" function inside of the draw function, this will redraw the background everytime, essentially creating a blank canvas everytime. Simply make sure that it is the same colour as before or else it will change the colour.
