                <p>
                    This section is much easier and quicker than the previous ones. In this section, i have learned how to use variables and basic animation. Lets first see how to use variables. Variables are a way to store data to be reused later. For example, you can use variables to store the size of something. You can then pass the variable's name instead of the number for the size. Now this sounds useless right now but variables are extremely useful. First off, you can put all your variables together so whenever you need to change something, you don't have to search through the entire code. Second, this allows you to change anything whenever you want with ease. Last but not least, this can be used multiple times. Lets use the previous example, say you want to make a square, you can make a second square of the same size at a different position with ease. Overall, variables are one of the most used things in programming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	Anyways, lets see how you make them. In some languages, you need to specify what type of data you want to store(string(text), int(number), etc...), although, javascript does this automatically for you. Simply make sure to say its a variable. To make the variable, you simply say "var" followed by the name, an equal sign and the value. Like this...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                	<li>Var size = 6;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	Here, you have created a variable called "size" which has a value of 6. Now you can go ahead and type the name of the variable instead everytime instea of writing 6. This might seem like a lot more work than simply typing 6, but overall it is a much better pratice since next time you will need to change this "6" multiple times, variables will come in handy. As a quick side note, variables can also not have any value, null... This means that no value is present. This can be pratical sometimes as this allows you to set the value when specific conditions are met. Anyways, now that we know how to use variables, lets learn how to make basic animations. This is still quite simple! All you need to do to prepare this is using 1 very specific function. The draw function. This function repeats anything(inside of it) until you tell it to stop by closing the window. This is what we are going to be using for animating since the drawing should be redrawn at different positions multiple times and not just once. This is what the draw function should look like.

                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                	<li>draw = function() {</li>
                	<li class="comment">//Blah blah blah, just random function stuff here</li>
                	<li>}</li>
                </ol>
