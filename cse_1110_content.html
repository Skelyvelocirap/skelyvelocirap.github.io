                    What is HTML(Hypertext markup language)? What is CSS(Cascading style sheet)? Let's first look at HTML. HTML is the structure a website. The bones in other words. Without HTML, this website would not have ANYTHING on it. It wouldn't even exist. Although, CSS is not required for a website but it greatly helps. CSS is essentially what makes the website looks nice. Without it, it would look like the default. Go ahead and try making a website without CSS after reading this, take a look at what it looks like. Anyways, let's starts of by learning how to use HTML. I will quickly give the code to start the page and explain how it all works right after. Anyways, this is the code.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthtml&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthead&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/head&gt</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>&ltbody&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/body&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/html&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Before explaining how these works, let's quickly learn about tags. Tags are simply what we call those lines of html. So, all of what you see above are tags. So anyways, let's take a look at how this works! First off... &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt. This is there to tell the program that we are using html five and not one of those really old versions of it. We then have the &lthtml&gt tag. This tag is essentially there to show what is part of the webpage. We then have the &lthead&gt tag. This is for the information about the page, this does not show any of the elements. This is where the title of a webpage goes, which will be mentioned later. We than have a different looking &lthead&gt tag. This time it has a forward slash in front. This is because it is a closing tag. Most tags in HTML have some thing called closing tag. These are essentially markers as to where the tag should end, this is because most tags are multiline tags, so you need to mention when it ends. Anyways, to make a closing tag, it works the same way but simply add a forward slash in front of the actualy words of the tag. Ok, next up is the &ltbody&gt tag. This one is where everything visible of the webpage goes, so issentially all your text, all your images etc... This also has a closing tag. You than have the closing tag for the &lthtml&gt tag. There we go, you now have the default structure of html. You won't see anything yet but at least there is a webpage that exists now.
                </p>
                <p class="important rounded">
                    Writing text can be done without tags. This is not recomended at all since it does not allow the text to be edited by CSS later on. It also may make's some tags being used become obsolete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that that is done, let's start adding information to the webpage. Let's start of with the &lttitle&gt tag(which has a closing tag). This tag is what will essentially give the webpage a name. What do i mean by that. Look at the top of your browser, where it displays the tabs. You might see that it says "Computer Science". That is because I have given this website a &lttitle&gt tag. Whatever you put in between your tag is going to be the name of it! Now, if you read the HTML part, you might remember strings. To write text in HTML, it does not work the same way. You do not need the quotes, you simply need the text. Anyways, let's quickly look at an example...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lttitle&gtComputer Science&lt/title&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This, when in your broswer, should give the tab the name of "Computer Science". Go ahead and try it! With your own site's name of course.
