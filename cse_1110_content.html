                    What is HTML(Hypertext markup language)? What is CSS(Cascading style sheet)? Let's first look at HTML. HTML is the structure a website. The bones in other words. Without HTML, this website would not have ANYTHING on it. It wouldn't even exist. Although, CSS is not required for a website but it greatly helps. CSS is essentially what makes the website looks nice. Without it, it would look like the default. Go ahead and try making a website without CSS after reading this, take a look at what it looks like. Anyways, let's starts of by learning how to use HTML. I will quickly give the code to start the page and explain how it all works right after. Anyways, this is the code.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthtml&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthead&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/head&gt</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>&ltbody&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/body&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/html&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Before explaining how these works, let's quickly learn about tags. Tags are simply what we call those lines of html. So, all of what you see above are tags. So anyways, let's take a look at how this works! First off... &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt. This is there to tell the program that we are using html five and not one of those really old versions of it. We then have the &lthtml&gt tag. This tag is essentially there to show what is part of the webpage. We then have the &lthead&gt tag. This is for the information about the page, this does not show any of the elements. This is where the title of a webpage goes, which will be mentioned later. We than have a different looking &lthead&gt tag. This time it has a forward slash in front. This is because it is a closing tag. Most tags in HTML have some thing called closing tag. These are essentially markers as to where the tag should end, this is because most tags are multiline tags, so you need to mention when it ends. Anyways, to make a closing tag, it works the same way but simply add a forward slash in front of the actualy words of the tag. Ok, next up is the &ltbody&gt tag. This one is where everything visible of the webpage goes, so issentially all your text, all your images etc... This also has a closing tag. You than have the closing tag for the &lthtml&gt tag. There we go, you now have the default structure of html. You won't see anything yet but at least there is a webpage that exists now.
                </p>
                <p class="important rounded">
                    Writing text can be done without tags. This is not recomended at all since it does not allow the text to be edited by CSS later on. It also may make's some tags being used become obsolete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that that is done, let's start adding information to the webpage. Let's start of with the &lttitle&gt tag(which has a closing tag). This tag is what will essentially give the webpage a name. What do i mean by that. Look at the top of your browser, where it displays the tabs. You might see that it says "Computer Science". That is because I have given this website a &lttitle&gt tag. Whatever you put in between your tag is going to be the name of it! Now, if you read the HTML part, you might remember strings. To write text in HTML, it does not work the same way. You do not need the quotes, you simply need the text. Anyways, let's quickly look at an example...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lttitle&gtComputer Science&lt/title&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This, when in your broswer, should give the tab the name of "Computer Science". Go ahead and try it! With your own site's name of course. Let's now move on to the next tag. The meta tag. The meta tag is essentially the biggest part of information or your site, this is where you can choose the character type, say who the author is, keywords, page description etc... Although, what it is mostly used for is the character's since the rest can mostly be typed in the document itself. Anyways, this is what it should look like.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As you can see, this one does not actually have a closing tag, this is because it only takes up one line, we refer to these as inline tags. The tags which take multiple lines are called block tags. Anyways, what this above does is mention the character set, it sets that to UTF-8 which is all of the characters(whether it be chinese characters, english letters or roman numerals). Anyways, this tag should also go in the &lthead&gt tag. This is what it should all currently look like.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthtml&gt</li>
                    <li>&lthead&gt</li>
                    <li>&lttitle&gtComputer Science&lt/title&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/head&gt</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>&ltbody&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/body&gt</li>
                    <li>&lt/html&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Now that the information is all set, let's go ahead and add an actual title to our page(one that will apear on the page itself and not the tab). To do this, let me introduce to you, the header tags. Header tags, as the name suggests, adds a header. Why am I refering to it as tags and not tag? That is because there are multiple, 6 to be exact. Each 1 has a small difference in size, 1 being the biggest all the way to 6 being the smallest. It is up to you what size you want to use. Currently, at the very top, i am using the biggest header, so 1. Anyways, let's see how to make them...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&lth1&gtThis is a header size 1&lt/h1&gt</li>
                    <li>&lth2&gtThis is a header size 2&lt/h2&gt</li>
                    <li>&lth3&gtThis is a header size 3&lt/h3&gt</li>
                    <li>&lth4&gtThis is a header size 4&lt/h4&gt</li>
                    <li>&lth5&gtThis is a header size 5&lt/h5&gt</li>
                    <li>&lth6&gtThis is a header size 6&lt/h6&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Pretty easy right? Just make sure to remember to add the closing tag! Now, let's say you want to add some text on the screen(properly), such as a paragraph. You can use a simply tag called the &ltp&gt tag. As the name suggests, it creates a paragraph. The &ltp&gt is a block tag, meaning it needs a closing tag. Anyways, simply add the text in between and it will write it out for you. It should look something like this...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&ltp&gtHello, I'm a paragraph. Look at me!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm a paragraph. Look at me!<br>
                    <br>
                    Up there is what it should give! Obviously, its not much of a paragraph but you get the picture. Just type for as long as you'd like, it will add all of it. Although, let's say you want to skip a line. You might have already noticed that pressing enter won't cut it. What you have to do is add 1 simple tag. This one is special because it doesn't require anything except the tag itself, no parameter, no text, no closing tag. Just the tag itself. The tag is called the break tag...&ltbr&gt. It simply skips to the next line. That is a very useful tag! I am actually using it now to separate the result of the code above from the rest of the paragraph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing we learned about was actually about the &ltstrong&gt and &ltem&gt tags. Both tags are quite simple but let's start of with the strong tag. What the &ltstrong&gt tag does is simply to bold the text in between the opening tag and closing tag. On the other hand, the &ltem&gt tag italicizes the text between the opening and closing tag. They can be used together or seperately from one another. Let's see how the three things should look like.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&ltp&gt&ltstrong&gtHello&lt/strong&gt&lt/p&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&ltp&gt&ltem&gtHello&lt/em&gt&lt/p&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                    <li>&ltp&gt&ltstrong&gt&ltem&gtHello&lt/em&gt&lt/strong&gt&lt/p&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hello</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Hello</em>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong><em>Hello</em></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    See all of those? The code above should give you those in the correct order. Quite nice isn't it? Anyways, this could be used to add emphasis to specific word or paragraphs. What you can put inside is not limited to just words, if you want you can put an entire page inside! Simply put that around the &ltbody&gt tag and the entire thing will be bolded! Although, it does not work for the title of the page, trust me I tried. It simply shows the tags as words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing we learned about was lists. You know, like numbered lists and bulleted lists. They are quite simple to make, anyways let's go ahead and see how it's done! In HTML, there are two kinds of lists. Ordered lists and unordered lists. The ordered list is what we call a numbered list. As for the unordered list, it is what we call a bulleted list. Anyways, let's take a look at how to make both.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="comment">//Ordered List</li>
                    <li>&ltol&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the first element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the second element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the third element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li class="comment">// And so on</li>
                    <li>&lt/ol&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    <li class="comment">//Unordered List</li>
                    <li>&ltul&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the first element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the second element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li>&ltli&gtThis is the third element of my list&lt/li&gt</li>
                    <li class="comment">// And so on</li>
                    <li>&lt/ul&gt</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Can you spot the difference between the two? If you can't, this is it. To make an ordered list, you need the &ltol&gt tag. While a unordered list, that requires a &ltul&gt tag. They both need the &ltli&gt tags inside since those are the list elements but the list itself uses a different tag. Anyways, this is what both should look like.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This is the first element of my list</li>
                    <li>This is the second element of my list</li>
                    <li>This is the third element of my list</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the first element of my list</li>
                    <li>This is the second element of my list</li>
                    <li>This is the third element of my list</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Fun fact, i am using ordered list with a lot of CSS to make my code boxes. I make just a normal list and simply give it the class(something mentioned later) of code-segment and rounded which i had to make myself. I would suggest looking at the code for it after finishing this(if you don't finish it, it will not make any sense) and try to make your own.
