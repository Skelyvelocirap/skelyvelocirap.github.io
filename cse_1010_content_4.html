                    Functions! Functions are extremely useful! Much like variables, it allows you to store data for later use. Instead of storing a value, functions store different functions(such as other functions you made or functions such as rect). With these functions, you can essentially do things such as create a house and call it multiple times to create maybe an entire city. In the function, you can make a rectangle for the house, other rectangles for the windows, triangles for the roof etc... You then simply call the function and it makes the house for you as many times as you call it. Creating a function is simply done by creating a variable but the value is "function()" followed by brackets. Inside of the parenthesis, you simply add parameters that can be used as variables. You then simply call the function. To call a function, you simply type the name of the function(It is case sensitive) followed by parenthesis along with any parameter if any are present. These are examples of what they should look like.

                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var myFunction = function(){</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Anything you want to run everytime the function is called goes in here</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Example \/</li>
                  <li>rect(100,100,100,100);</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                  <li></li>
                  <li>myFunction();</li>
                </ol>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var alsoAFunction = function(position, size){</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Anything you want to run everytime the function is called goes in here</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Example \/</li>
                  <li>rect(position, position, size, size)</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                  <li></li>
                  <li>alsoAFunction(100, 100);</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Both of these functions are doing the same thing. The only difference is that you instead have to change the value fed to the function instead of the rectangle directly. In the second example, "position" and "size" act just like variables, you can reuse them as many times as you want. You can also feed variables to the function instead of directly giving it numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next up on the list, logic statements. These guys are whats truly behind anything. As the name suggests, it deals with logic. Say you want text to appear only once a variable hits a very specific number, logic statements can help you with that. There really only are 3 things you need to know to use them, let's start. To make your first logic statement, simply type this...
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var theNumber = 0</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Yes, very creative i know</li>
                  <li>if(theNumber == 10){</li>
                  <li>  text("Yay! The value is now ten!");</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  So, what this does is create a variable called "theNumber". It then checks whether or not the condition in the parenthesis is true, in this case asking if "theNumber" is 10. If it isn't, then nothing happens. Although, if the value is 10 than it will run anything in the brackets, in this case being displaying the text. Obviously, this could be used for so much more than saying that the value is 10, this is what is behind any bit of logic, along with the two other things which work in correlation with "if". Let's go ahead and see the second thing.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var theNumber = 0</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Yes, very creative i know</li>
                  <li>if(theNumber == 10){</li>
                  <li>  text("Yay! The value is now ten!");</li>
                  <li>} else {</li>
                  <li>  text("Ehh, not quite there yet!");</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This might seem similar but trust me, it's not. I simply had to reuse part of the code before. Anyways, you might spot there is 1 extra thing added. After closing the brackets for "If"(This is called an If statement by the way), there is "else"(else statement) written. What this does is simply say, if any of the above condition is not true then you run this part. If you were to simply add the text after the brackets, it would run whether the condition is correct or not. The last thing we learned with these is this.
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var theNumber = 0</li>
                  <li class="comment">//Yes, very creative i know</li>
                  <li>if(theNumber == 10){</li>
                  <li>  text("Yay! The value is now ten!");</li>
                  <li>} else if(theNumber == 20) {</li>
                  <li>  text("Not what i originally wanted but 20 is still fine!");</li>
                  <li>} else {</li>
                  <li>  text("Ehh, not quite there yet!");</li>
                  <li>}</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Once again, we added 1 more thing to the code above. This time, look right after the first else statement, you might see that we have written "if". This is called an else-if statement, what it does is if the first condition is not true, then it checks this one. You can have as many else-if statements as you'd like. Most commonly, you will want to put an else statement at the end but that simply depends on what you need it to do. You might have noticed that we have 2 equal signs instead of 1. This is because these are called operators. Operators are simply there to say how it should check the value. I didn't explain it well but hopefully, this should.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "===" Equal in value and type<br>
                  "==" Equal in value only<br>
                  "!" not equal to<br>
                  ">" greater than<br>
                  "<" less than<br>
                  "&&" and<br>
                  "||" or
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of these operators help to decide how you want to check the value. Is it bigger than the second value? Is this correct AND is this as well? This is what these do. Although, before we move on to the next section, there is one more thing I need to show. This is not exactly to do with this but it can definitely help. These are a few "math functions" that could help check things, lets first start off with random. Random is a way to generate a random number between(and including) the numbers specified in the parenthesis. To do so, you simply create a variable(or just use it instead of a variable), but instead of giving it a number as value, use "random()" as a value with 2 numbers inside the parenthesis. A bit like this!
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li>var randomInt = random(0, 100);</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  This above will create a variable called "randomInt" and set the value to be any number between(including) 0 and 100. This when used with if statements could be used to give a random reward to someone depending on if the random number is the correct number. As a quick side note though, this does give a decimal value, so you do need to round it. For this, there are two functions... Floor, and ceil. These are quite simple, they return the rounded value of what you put in the parenthesis inside of them. The only difference between the 2 is that floor rounds down and ceil rounds up. There is no functoin for rounding to the nearest integer, although you can add 0.5 to the value given and use that for floor. This is what it should all look like! 
                </p>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li class="comment">//Flooring</li>
                  <li>var randomInt = random(0, 100);</li>
                  <li>randomInt = floor(randomInt);</li>
                </ol>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li class="comment">//Ceiling</li>
                  <li>var randomInt = random(0, 100);</li>
                  <li>randomInt = ceil(randomInt);</li>
                </ol>
                <ol class="code-segment rounded">
                  <li class="comment">//Rounding</li>
                  <li>var randomInt = random(0, 100);</li>
                  <li>randomInt = floor(randomInt + 0.5);</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  There you go! The first one rounds down, the second one rounds up and the third rounds to the nearest integer. Feel free to use any of these to make the logic behind your website work better! :D
